# capture.js

A library for capturing your DOM. 

## How to install

    $ npm install
    $ bower install

Check if everything works by running the tests:

    $ grunt test

## How to create and ship a change

Run the following command to watch and build the capture.js file
as you develop:

	$ grunt serve

Then, do the following to ship the change:

* Make your code changes and create a pull-request
* Ensure the tests still work (`grunt test`)
* Get your change reviewed and :+1:'ed

## Roadmap

- Add instructions on how to use capture.js stand-alone (currently
  capture.js is something that is integrated into mobify.js)

## Where to get help
